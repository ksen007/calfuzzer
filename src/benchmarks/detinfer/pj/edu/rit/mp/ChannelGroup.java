/**
 * Class ChannelGroup provides a group of {@linkplain Channel}s for sending and
 * receiving messages in the Message Protocol (MP).
 * <P>
 * <B>Creating Channels</B>
 * <P>
 * A channel group can be used to create channels in two ways: by accepting a
 * connection request from another process, and by requesting a connection to
 * another process.
 * <P>
 * The channel group can be configured to listen to a certain host and port for
 * connection requests. Configure the host and port by by calling the
 * <TT>listen()</TT> method. To start accepting connection requests, call the
 * <TT>startListening()</TT> method.
 * <P>
 * If desired, an application can receive notification of newly created channels
 * by providing a {@linkplain ConnectListener} object to the channel group's
 * <TT>setConnectListener()</TT> method. Specify a connect listener object
 * before calling the <TT>startListening()</TT> method, otherwise the
 * application may not receive some notifications.
 * <P>
 * When a connection request arrives, the channel group sets up a new channel
 * object for communicating over the connection. If a connect listener has been
 * registered, the channel group then passes the channel to the connect
 * listener's <TT>farEndConnected()</TT> method, which does whatever the
 * application needs to record the new channel's presence. The channel does not
 * start sending and receiving messages until after the connect listener's
 * <TT>farEndConnected()</TT> method (if any) has returned.
 * <P>
 * The application can also call the channel group's <TT>connect()</TT> method
 * to request a connection to another host and port. The channel group sets up a
 * new channel object for communicating over the connection. If a connect
 * listener has been registered, the channel group then passes the channel to
 * the connect listener's <TT>nearEndConnected()</TT> method, which does
 * whatever the application needs to record the new channel's presence. The
 * channel does not start sending and receiving messages until after the connect
 * listener's <TT>nearEndConnected()</TT> method (if any) has returned. The
 * <TT>connect()</TT> method also returns the new channel.
 * <P>
 * Once a connection has been set up and a channel object has been created on
 * each side, the applications can use their respective channels to send and
 * receive messages.
 * <P>
 * If a channel group does not need to accept incoming connection requests, the
 * channel group need not listen to any host and port. The channel group can
 * still be used to make outgoing connection requests.
 * <P>
 * <B>Channel Group IDs</B>
 * <P>
 * Each channel group has a channel group ID. The channel group ID is an
 * integer, initially 0, that can be changed by the <TT>setChannelGroupId()</TT>
 * method. The channel group attaches no significance to the channel group ID;
 * it is provided for the use of the application using the channel group.
 * <P>
 * You can query a channel group object to determine its channel group ID. You
 * can also query a channel object to determine the ID of the channel group at
 * the near end of the channel and the ID of the channel group at the far end of
 * the channel.
 * <P>
 * <B>Sending Messages</B>
 * <P>
 * To send a message, the application creates a message buffer (class
 * {@linkplain Buf}) specifying where to get the items to be sent. The
 * application calls the channel group's <TT>send()</TT> method, passing the
 * channel on which to send the message, the message buffer, and the message
 * tag. (If the message tag is not specified, it defaults to 0.) The channel
 * group extracts the items from the message buffer and sends a message over the
 * channel's connection. When the <TT>send()</TT> method returns, the message
 * has been fully sent, but the message may not have been fully received yet.
 * <P>
 * The far end application must receive the message from the channel at the
 * other end of the connection. If no application is receiving the message, the
 * <TT>send()</TT> method may block (because of flow control). This in turn may
 * lead to a deadlock.
 * <P>
 * At most one outgoing message at a time may be in progress on a channel. If a
 * second thread tries to send a message on a channel while a first thread is
 * still sending a message on that channel, the second thread will block until
 * the first thread has finished sending the message.
 * <P>
 * <B>Receiving Messages</B>
 * <P>
 * To receive a message, the application creates a message buffer (class
 * {@linkplain Buf}) specifying where to put the items to be received. The
 * application calls the channel group's <TT>receive()</TT> method, passing the
 * channel from which to receive the message, the desired message tag, and the
 * message buffer. The application can specify "any channel" instead of a
 * specific channel. The application can specify a range of tags or "any tag"
 * instead of a specific tag. Any number of threads can have receive requests
 * pending at the same time.
 * <P>
 * When the channel group receives a message from a channel, the channel group
 * tries to match the message with the pending receive requests. A message
 * matches a receive request if (a) the message's channel is the same as the
 * receive request's channel, or the receive request specified "any channel;"
 * and (b) the message's tag is the same as the receive request's tag, or the
 * message's tag falls within the receive request's range of tags, or the
 * receive request specified "any tag;" and (c) the message's item type is the
 * same as the receive request's item type (as given by the message buffer). The
 * pending receive requests are maintained in FIFO order. If no receive request
 * matches the message, the channel group does not read the message until such
 * time as a matching receive request occurs. If more than one receive request
 * matches the message, the channel group chooses the first matching receive
 * request.
 * <P>
 * Once the channel group has matched the incoming message with the receive
 * request, the channel group reads the items from the message and stores them
 * into the message buffer. If there are fewer items in the message than the
 * length of the message buffer, the extra items at the end of the message
 * buffer are not set to anything. If there are more items in the message than
 * the length of the message buffer, the extra items are read from the message
 * and discarded. Once the message has been read, the <TT>receive()</TT> method
 * returns a {@linkplain Status} object reporting the channel on which the
 * message arrived, the message tag, and the actual number of items in the
 * message (which may or may not be the same as the number of items in the
 * message buffer).
 * <P>
 * If the receive requests do not match properly with the incoming messages, a
 * deadlock may occur.
 * <P>
 * <B>Sending and Receiving Within the Same Process</B>
 * <P>
 * Each channel group has a "loopback" channel that is used to send messages
 * within the same process. To obtain the loopback channel, call the
 * <TT>loopbackChannel()</TT> method. Then one thread can send messages using
 * the loopback channel while a different thread receives messages using the
 * loopback channel. If the same thread both sends and receives using the
 * loopback channel, a deadlock may occur.
 * <P>
 * The loopback channel uses the <TT>copy()</TT> method of class {@linkplain
 * Buf} to transfer data items directly from the source buffer to the
 * destination buffer. The loopback channel does not do any network
 * communication.
 * <P>
 * <B>Non-Blocking Send and Receive Operations</B>
 * <P>
 * The <TT>send()</TT> method described so far does a <B>blocking send</B>
 * operation; the <TT>send()</TT> method does not return until the message has
 * been fully sent. There is also a <B>non-blocking send</B> operation,
 * <TT>sendNoWait()</TT>, which includes an {@linkplain IORequest} argument. The
 * <TT>sendNoWait()</TT> method initiates the send operation and returns
 * immediately. This allows the caller to continue processing while the channel
 * group sends the message in a separate thread. To wait for the message to be
 * fully sent, the caller must call the IORequest object's
 * <TT>waitForFinish()</TT> method.
 * <P>
 * Likewise, the <TT>receive()</TT> method described so far does a <B>blocking
 * receive</B> operation; the <TT>receive()</TT> method does not return until
 * the message has been fully received. There is also a <B>non-blocking
 * receive</B> operation, <TT>receiveNoWait()</TT>, which includes an
 * {@linkplain IORequest} argument. The <TT>receiveNoWait()</TT> method
 * initiates the receive operation and returns immediately. This allows the
 * caller to continue processing while the channel group receives the message in
 * a separate thread. To wait for the message to be fully received, the caller
 * must call the IORequest object's <TT>waitForFinish()</TT> method, which
 * returns a {@linkplain Status} object giving the results of the receive
 * operation.
